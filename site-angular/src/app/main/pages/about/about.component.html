            <h1>About</h1>

            <p>The functionome is the set of all annotated functional characteristics ("annotations") for human
                protein-coding genes, as determined by the PAN-GO (Phylogenetic ANnotation using Gene Ontology) project
                <a>[link to paper when available]</a>, a collaboration between the <a href="http://geneontology.org/"
                    target="_blank">Gene Ontology Consortium</a> and the <a href="http://www.pantherdb.org/"
                    target="_blank">PANTHER</a>
                evolutionary tree resource. Each gene in the human genome has been "annotated" with one or more terms
                from the Gene Ontology, and therefore each annotation represents a functional characteristic of a
                protein that is encoded by that gene.
            </p>

            <p>The annotation table shows all PAN-GO annotations by default and can be filtered (in the left panel) to
                find annotations of interest. Clicking on a gene symbol in the first column of the table will show all
                annotations for that gene, including all evidence.</p>

            <p>The current functionome website is designed to support three main use-cases:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Find all functional characteristics for a gene of interest:</strong> Type the gene symbol,
                    name, or identifier into the "filter by gene" box, and select your gene from the autocomplete.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Explore the human genome by functional category:</strong> Find all genes in a given category
                    of functional characteristic. Browse the graph of categories in the left panel, and click to filter
                    the list of annotations to include only those in the selected functional category. You can then read
                    more about each gene and follow links to additional information about that gene.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Find all genes that have not yet been associated with any functional
                        characteristics:</strong> Find these by clicking on "Unknown aspects" in the Knowledge Status
                    filter in the left panel. You can further filter by selecting a GO function aspect (molecular
                    function, biological process, or cellular component).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Important details:</strong></p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>EVIDENCE for annotations:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>All annotations are based on experimental evidence, which is shown in the table. This evidence
                        may include a direct experiment on the human gene itself ("direct" evidence) or may only include
                        experiments on a homologous, i.e., evolutionarily related, gene ("homology" evidence).</li>
                    <li>Evidence is organized by the gene for which the experimental evidence was obtained, which can be
                        either a human gene (labeled Hsa, for Homo sapiens) or another organism (click on the link to
                        get information about the species).</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS of annotations:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annotations are updated regularly. If you see an incorrect annotation or cannot find an
                        annotation that should be included, please click on the Help link and report it. When suggesting
                        a new annotation, please include a link to the publication that provides experimental evidence.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>ANNOTATION CATEGORIES:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annotation categories are relatively high-level GO terms, and each annotated GO term is assigned
                        to one (or sometimes more) category using the structure of GO.</li>
                    <li>Annotation categories do not cover all GO term annotations. If an annotated GO term is not in
                        any of the categories, the annotation will be assigned to other molecular function, other
                        biological process, or other cellular component.</li>
                    <li>Some categories are subcategories of others. In this case, to make the categories more useful,
                        we assign an annotation only to its most specific category. This means that filtering by the
                        larger category will filter out genes that are in a subcategory, and you will have to select the
                        subcategory separately to review these. The main categories this applies to are:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Catalytic activity. This will include mostly enzymes that act to transform one small
                            molecule into another, as enzymes that act directly on proteins, DNA, or RNA can be found in
                            subcategories. The category catalytic activity, acting on protein also has even more
                            specific subcategories for protein kinases and proteases, as these include many human genes.
                        </li>
                        <li>DNA binding. This will exclude DNA binding transcription factors, which have their own
                            category.</li>
                        <li>Organelle. This will exclude the specific organellar locations in other categories of
                            Cellular Component annotations. Similarly, the nucleus has even more specific subcategories
                            such as nuclear envelope and nucleoplasm.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Each annotation may be assigned to more than one category, in which case you will find the
                        annotation under multiple categories.</li>
                    <li>Each gene may have multiple distinct annotations that are assigned to the same category. As a
                        result, the number of genes in a category may be less than the total number of annotations.</li>
