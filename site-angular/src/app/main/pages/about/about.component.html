                The Human Gene Functionome
            </h2>
            <p>
                The functionome is the set of all annotated functional characteristics
                (“annotations”) for human protein-coding genes, as determined by the PAN-GO
                (Phylogenetic Annotation using Gene Ontology) project [link to paper when
                available]. Each gene in the human genome has been “annotated” with one or
                more terms from the Gene Ontology [link to GO website], and therefore each
                annotation represents a functional characteristic of a protein that is
                encoded by that gene.
            </p>
            <div>
                The current functionome website is designed to support three main
                use-cases:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Find all functional characteristics for a gene of interest. Type
                        the gene symbol, name or identifier into the “filter by gene” box,
                        and select your gene from the autocomplete.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Explore the human genome by functional category, and find all genes
                        in a given category of functional characteristic. Browse the graph
                        of categories in the left panel, and click to filter the list of
                        annotations to include only those in the selected functional
                        category. You can then read more about each gene, and follow links
                        to additional information about that gene.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Find all genes that have not yet been associated with any
                        functional characteristics, for a given type of characteristic.
                        Find these in the left panel under either molecular function
                        unknown, biological process unknown, or cellular component unknown
                        and click to select.

                        <li>
                            All annotations are based on experimental evidence, which is
                            shown in the table. This evidence may include a direct
                            experiment on the human gene itself (“direct” evidence) or may
                            only include experiments on a homologous, i.e. evolutionarily
                            related, gene (“homology” evidence).

                        <li>
                            Some “annotations” are merely a statement that there are no
                            evidence-supported annotations for a gene in a particular
                            functional aspect of GO (molecular function unknown, biological
                            process unknown, or cellular component unknown). There is no
                            evidence for these by definition, so they are marked as
                            evidence type “n/a” (not applicable).

                        <li>
                            Annotations are updated regularly. If you see an incorrect
                            annotation, or cannot find an annotation that should be
                            included, please click on the Help link and report it. When
                            suggesting a new annotation, please include a link to the
                            publication that provides experimental evidence.

                            Annotation categories are relatively high-level GO terms, and
                            each annotated GO term is assigned to one (or sometimes more)
                            category using the structure of GO.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Annotation categories do not cover all GO term annotations. If
                            an annotated GO term is not in any of the categories, the
                            annotation will be assigned to other molecular function, other
                            biological process or other cellular component.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Some categories are subcategories of others. In this case, to
                            make the categories more useful, we assign an annotation only
                            to its most specific category. This means that filtering by the
                            larger category will filter out genes that are in a
                            subcategory, and you will have to select the subcategory
                            separately to review these. The main categories this applies to
                            are:
                        </li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Catalytic activity. This will include mostly enzymes that
                                act to transform one small molecule into another, as
                                enzymes that act directly on proteins, DNA or RNA can be
                                found in subcategories. The category catalytic activity,
                                acting on protein also has even more specific subcategories
                                for protein kinases and proteases, as these include many
                                human genes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                DNA binding. This will exclude DNA binding transcription
                                factors, which have their own category.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Organelle. This will exclude the specific organellar
                                locations in other categories of Cellular Component
                                annotations. Similarly, nucleus has even more specific
                                subcategories such as nuclear envelope and nucleoplasm.
                            </li>

                        <li>
                            Each annotation may be assigned to more than one category, in
                            which case you will find the annotation under multiple
                            categories.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each gene may have multiple distinct annotations that are
                            assigned to the same category. As a result, the number of genes
                            in a category may be less than the total number of annotations.
