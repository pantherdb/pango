            About the human gene functionome

            The functionome is the set of all annotated functional characteristics (“annotations”) for human
            protein-coding genes, as determined by the PAN-GO (Phylogenetic Annotation using Gene Ontology) project
            [link to paper when available]. Each gene in the human genome has been “annotated” with one or more terms
            from the Gene Ontology [link to GO website], and therefore each annotation represents a functional
            characteristic of a protein that is encoded by that gene.

            The current functionome website is designed to support three main use-cases:
            Find all functional characteristics for a gene of interest. Type the gene symbol, name or identifier into
            the “filter by gene” box, and select your gene from the autocomplete.
            Explore the human genome by functional category, and find all genes in a given category of functional
            characteristic. Browse the graph of categories in the left panel, and click to filter the list of
            annotations to include only those in the selected functional category. You can then read more about each
            gene, and follow links to additional information about that gene.
            Find all genes that have not yet been associated with any functional characteristics, for a given type of
            characteristic. Find these in the left panel– under either molecular function unknown, biological process
            unknown, or cellular component unknown– and click to select.

            Important details:
            EVIDENCE for annotations.
            All annotations are based on experimental evidence, which is shown in the table. This evidence may include a
            direct experiment on the human gene itself (“direct” evidence) or may only include experiments on a
            homologous, i.e. evolutionarily related, gene (“homology” evidence).
            Some “annotations” are merely a statement that there are no evidence-supported annotations for a gene in a
            particular functional aspect of GO (molecular function unknown, biological process unknown, or cellular
            component unknown). There is no evidence for these by definition, so they are marked as evidence type “n/a”
            (not applicable).
            ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS of annotations.
            Annotations are updated regularly. If you see an incorrect annotation, or cannot find an annotation that
            should be included, please click on the Help link and report it. When suggesting a new annotation, please
            include a link to the publication that provides experimental evidence.
            ANNOTATION CATEGORIES.
            Annotation categories are relatively high-level GO terms, and each annotated GO term is assigned to one (or
            sometimes more) category using the structure of GO.
            Annotation categories do not cover all GO term annotations. If an annotated GO term is not in any of the
            categories, the annotation will be assigned to other molecular function, other biological process or other
            cellular component.
            Some categories are subcategories of others. In this case, to make the categories more useful, we assign an
            annotation only to its most specific category. This means that filtering by the larger category will filter
            out genes that are in a subcategory, and you will have to select the subcategory separately to review these.
            The main categories this applies to are:
            Catalytic activity. This will include mostly enzymes that act to transform one small molecule into another,
            as enzymes that act directly on proteins, DNA or RNA can be found in subcategories. The category catalytic
            activity, acting on protein also has even more specific subcategories for protein kinases and proteases, as
            these include many human genes.
            DNA binding. This will exclude DNA binding transcription factors, which have their own category.
            Organelle. This will exclude the specific organellar locations in other categories of Cellular Component
            annotations. Similarly, nucleus has even more specific subcategories such as nuclear envelope and
            nucleoplasm.
            Each annotation may be assigned to more than one category, in which case you will find the annotation under
            multiple categories.
            Each gene may have multiple distinct annotations that are assigned to the same category. As a result, the
            number of genes in a category may be less than the total number of annotations.
